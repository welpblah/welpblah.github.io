## about the website

The website is built with [barf](https://git.sr.ht/~bt/barf), a website generator in ~100 lines of shell. The fonts are set on [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/) and [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/fantasque-sans-mono).

There is a feed available for the weblog portion of the website: [Atom](/atom.xml); [RSS](/rss.xml). As the domain suggets, the website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The [source code is available on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/welpblah/log).
