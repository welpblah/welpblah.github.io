    excerpts: nicola masciandaro’s four great errors
   </h1>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Nobody knows who you are | No one ever will | Anonymous as a star |
Or a whippoorwill.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     For a moment I was here | Almost someone me | Until I saw I too near
| Knew it could not be.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Meet me where we were before | We were, before time | Divided one
into your | I mirroring mine.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Nothing wrong with being lost | Losing where to go | Bewilderment is
the cost | Of wanting to know.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     How it all comes down to this | None will ever know | There are no
mouths for this kiss | No heads for this blow.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     River of earth, old and new | Song without singers | Everything is
slipping through | Everyone’s fingers.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Everything is happening | Because nothing is | Like being in a
painting | Where there’s only this.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Your body is like a soul | And vice versa | A hypersingular whole |
One universal.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The impossibility | Written in your face | The strongest fragility |
Anyone might trace.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     As all place is Mother’s lap | And we are right here | Let’s side by
side take a nap | In love without fear.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Everyone knows everything | Just don’t want to say | As if to bury
the sting | Is better that way.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     As reality is true | &amp; infinitely | So there is both me &amp; you
| Spontaneously.
    </p>
