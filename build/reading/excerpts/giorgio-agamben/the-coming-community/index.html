    excerpts: giorgio agamben’s the coming community
   </h1>
   <h2>
    iv. taking place
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The transcendent, therefore, is not a supreme entity above all
things; rather, <em>the pure transcendent is the taking-place of every
thing</em>.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Evil… is the reduction of the taking-place of things to a fact like
others, the forgetting of the transcendence inherent in the very
taking-place of things. With respect to these things, however, the good
is not somewhere else; it is simply the point at which they grasp the
taking-place proper to them, at which they touch their own
non-transcendent matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this sense-and only in this sense-the good must be defined as a
self-grasping of evil, and salvation as the coming of the place to
itself.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <h2>
    appendix: the irreparable
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Revelation does not mean revelation of the sacredness of the world,
but only revelation of its irreparably profane character. (The name
always and only names things.) Revelation consigns the world to
profanation and thingness–and isn’t this precisely what has happened?
The possibility of salvation begins only at this point; it is the
salvation of the profanity of the world, of its being-thus.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The world of the happy and that of the unhappy, the good and that of
the evil contain the same states of things; with respect to their
being-thus they are perfectly identical. The just person does not reside
in another world. The one who is saved and the one who is lost have the
same arms and legs. The glorious body cannot but be the mortal body
itself. What changes are not the things but their limits. It is as if
there hovered over them something like a halo, a glory.
    </p>
