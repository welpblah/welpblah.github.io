    appendix: the irreparable
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The world of the happy and that of the unhappy, the good and that of
the evil contain the same states of things; with respect to their
being-thus they are perfectly identical. The just person does not reside
in another world. The one who is saved and the one who is lost have the
same arms and legs. The glorious body cannot but be the mortal body
itself. What changes are not the things but their limits. It is as if
there hovered over them something like a halo, a glory.
