# resources

<aside>The web today may consist of an anxiety-producing overabundance of labyrinths, but here and there, we come across the noteworthy. <br><br> The list below represents some resources I, myself, use or have used and recommend.</aside>

## software

- [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/)
> Execute Program is a learning platform built by developers for developers, because we thought there should be a better way to learn – and remember – programming languages and tools.

## philosophy

- *[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/)*
> The *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)* organizes scholars from around the world in philosophy and related disciplines to create and maintain an up-to-date reference work.

I'm also part of the *[Friends of the SEP Society](https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/)*, primarily to print out the entries in single-column half-sheets, but there are other benefits like knowing when an entry has been updated based off your last download.

- *[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews](https://ndpr.nd.edu/)*
> *Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews* is entirely devoted to publishing substantive, high-quality scholarly philosophy books reviews.

Reviews like [Non-Being: New Essays on the Metaphysics of Non-existence](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/non-being-new-essays-on-the-metaphysics-of-non-existence/).

- *[The Review of Metaphysics](https://reviewofmetaphysics.org/)*
> Published for over seventy-five years, *The Review of Metaphysics* has established itself as an unrivaled resource for the profession both in the major research libraries of the world and in the private libraries of professors, scholars, and students of philosophy

- *[Philosophical Review](https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review)*
> The journal aims to publish original scholarly work in all areas of analytic philosophy, with an emphasis on material of general interest to academic philosophers, and is one of the few journals in the discipline to publish book reviews.

## general

- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
> Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free texts, movies, software, music, websites, and more.

I recommend checking out the [Claremont School of Theology Library Donation](https://archive.org/details/claremont_school_of_theology).

- [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)
> Open Library is an open, editable library catalog, building towards a web page for every book ever published.

- [The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/)
> Founded in 2011, _The Public Domain Review_ is an online journal and not-for-profit project dedicated to the exploration of curious and compelling works from the history of art, literature, and ideas.
