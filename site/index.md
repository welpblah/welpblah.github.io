Hey there! My name is Bernardino. Born in México, I was raised and reside in California. I find beauty in both logic and intuition, with a natural leaning towards the latter. I’m infintely curious, after all: “wonder is simply the expression of ‘I’ within matter.”

This is my personal (in other words, anything goes) web site. Here you may find a small illustration of things I care for, e.g., the written word and the World Wide Web, to name a couple generalizations.
