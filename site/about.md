## about the webmaster

I'm interested in [software](/blog) by trade and [philosophy](/reading) by calling. Of course, I find a seemingly infinite amount of other domains interesting too.

You may reach me at [blog@sunra.sh](mailto:blog@sunra.sh).

## about the website

The site is built with [Soupault](https://soupault.app/), a static website management tool. The fonts are set on [Luciole](https://www.luciole-vision.com/) and [Andika](https://software.sil.org/andika/).

The site is hosted by [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/), where the [source code is available](https://github.com/welpblah/welpblah.github.io). The content of the site is [CC BY-SA](/LICENSE-content.txt) and the code of the site is [MIT](/LICENSE-code.txt).

The domain name is the word and intended name of the site, ‘sunrash’ (note: no space), and a reference to the late [Sun Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra), the musician.
