The `abbr` HTML element represents an abbreviation/acronym. The element is useless if (1) it is without the `title` attribute stating what the abbrevation/acronym means via the browser tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the element or (2) it is without text, after or before the element, explicitly stating what the abbrevation/acronym means. The most accessibly-friendly approach is using both tactics. Although, there is, I think, an acceptable medium.

You may paste this in the [HTML Online Viewer](https://html.onlineviewer.net/) to see a demo:

```html
<style>
abbr[title] {
    cursor: help;
}

abbr[title]:hover::after {
    content: " (" attr(title) ")";
}
</style>

This an <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr> element tag.
```

The meat of the trick is in the `content` property declaration value making use of the `attr()` CSS function.

According to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr):

> The `attr()` CSS function is used to retrieve the value of an attribute of the selected element and use it in the stylesheet. It can also be used on pseudo-elements, in which case the value of the attribute on the pseudo-element's originating element is returned.

It is therefore seemingly self-explanatory: when hovering over the `abbr` element, two points of information are available, the browser tooltip and the text inside the paranthesis after the `abbr` element value, both generated by the `title` attribute.
