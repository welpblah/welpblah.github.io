In todayâ€™s day and age, one might question: Where may I find sensibility? The answer: Well, certainly not in the popular. Here are a few sensible software services being offered today that are seemingly unknown (at least to the lay, the non-technical):

- Need a place to put your code? Check out [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/). It's fast! And, best of all, it works without JavaScript!
	- Need a static website? [Sourcehut Pages](https://srht.site/) is one of the few great places on the web for a static website today.
	- Alternatively, there is [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) (and [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page)), a non-profit and community-led organization. <mark>Completely free!</mark>
- Need an email provider? Look no further than [Purelymail](https://purelymail.com/). It's fast and simple.
	- Alternatively, there's [Migadu](https://migadu.com/), if you have your own domain (note: Purelymail also supports domains).
- Need an easy way to write online? [Write.as](https://write.as/) is neat! <mark>There's a free tier with some limitations.</mark>
- Need to stay up to date with your online media? Return to <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> with [BazQux](https://bazqux.com), a mindful way to consume.
	- Prefer a desktop application for your feed reader? I recently stumbled upon [yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr) and use it. <mark>Free!</mark>

What all these services have in common is that they are either ran by one person (two of the above I'm certain) or by a really small team, all to which are rather receptive.
