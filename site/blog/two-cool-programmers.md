A couple of interesting programmers I've come across this past year are [Kevin Boone](https://github.com/kevinboone/) and Greg Miller.

Boone particularly for his [Bash script to display the moon phase on some date](https://github.com/kevinboone/moonphase.sh). His most popular project is a [command-line utility for extracting text from EPUB documents](https://github.com/kevinboone/epub2txt2).

Miller for his [Celestial Programming: Greg Miller's Astronomy Programming Page](https://www.celestialprogramming.com/). Some of his programs reference a book titled *[Astronomical Algorithms](https://archive.org/details/astronomicalalgorithmsjeanmeeus1991)* (Willmann-Bell, 1991) by Jean Meeus–interesting.

As someone who likes looking at the moon, I like the idea of extending Boone's simple script with one or more of Miller's highly technical programs. For instance–you know, so as to know when I should go out and about–Miller's [program for determining the position of the moon](https://www.celestialprogramming.com/meeus-elp82.html) using an algorithm from the aforementioned book.
